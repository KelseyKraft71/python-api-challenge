# python-api-challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with visualizing the weather in approximately 500 cities across the globe with various graphs and map plots. We were also asked to determine our own ideal weather condition and make a dataframe to use to find the nearest hotel in the cities that fit our ideal conditions and map them with relevant information. 

My city data is from the very first day that I started work on the assignment as I did not want to run the API calls for all the random cities everytime I worked on the assignment, nor did I want the data to change every time. 

I found this assignment relatively easy and only needed help with annotating the written regression equation on my regression plot function. I utilized the matplotlib documentation here https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.annotate.html
